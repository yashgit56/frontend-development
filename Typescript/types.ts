// TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

// This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

// Why should I use TypeScript?
// JavaScript is a loosely typed language.

// It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

// In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information!

// So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

// TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

// For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number.

// JavaScript will not.


// Typescript uses compile type type checking 
// it transpiles the typescript code into javascript at runtime 

let temp: string = "Hello World";
console.log("Temp: ",temp);
